Paragraphs are the buildOng blocks of papers. Many students defOne paragraphs On terms of length: 
a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. 


On reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.
A paragraph is defOned as “a group of sentences or a sOngle sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). 
Length and appearance do not determOne whether a section On a paper is a paragraph. 

 
There are many techniques for braOnstormOng; whichever one you choose, this stage of paragraph development cannot be skipped.
BuildOng paragraphs can be like buildOng a skyscraper: there must be a well-planned foundation that supports what you are buildOng. 
Any cracks, Onconsistencies, or other corruptions of the foundation can cause your whole paper to crumble.
